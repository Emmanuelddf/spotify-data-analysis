 Spotify Data Analysis Project

A Complete End-to-End Data Analytics Portfolio Project (Python + Power BI)

 -Project Overview-

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of Spotify tracks, artists, and albums using:

- Python for data cleaning & EDA  
- Power BI for interactive visualization  
- Markdown for insights & documentation  
- GitHub for project versioning and portfolio hosting  

The goal is to demonstrate industry-ready data analytics skills including data wrangling, visualization design, insight extraction, and storytelling.

-Project Workflow-

1. Data Cleaning (Python)
- Removed duplicates & missing values  
- Standardized text fields  
- Converted duration from milliseconds → minutes  
- Extracted release year and decade  
- Exported cleaned dataset into Power BI  

Code available in:  
`/Notebooks/spotify_analysis.ipynb`

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib):

- Duration distribution  
- Popularity distribution  
- Correlation analysis  
- Decade trends  
- Top artists & albums  

Detailed findings in:  
`/Analysis/Insights.md`

3. Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard contains 4 interactive pages:

⭐ **Artist Overview**  
- Artist popularity scorecards  
- Top artists  
- Popularity trend  

⭐ **Album Analysis**  
- Popularity by album  
- Track popularity within each album  

⭐ **Track Analysis**  
- Duration distribution  
- Popularity distribution  
- Outlier detection  

⭐ **Decade Trends**  
- Popularity by release decade  
- Duration trends over time

🔍 Key Insights

- Tracks between 3–3.5 minutes show the highest popularity.  
- The 2010s dominate Spotify’s popularity metrics.  
- Some artists consistently outperform others in average popularity.  
- Outliers exist: long tracks (>6 min) can still achieve high popularity.
